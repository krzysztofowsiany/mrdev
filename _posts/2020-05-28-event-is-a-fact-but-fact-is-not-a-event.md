Les’s start with facts. How to understood fact.

*This is some kind of truth. Of course, if we don’t manipulate facts.*

We will see the past. History is filled with many facts. Some are more important others aren’t. But the fact always has some strong and important information.

If we know the facts? We can tell a story, stories. That same fact can be the core of many stories. Fact is information about something that happened. That is the truth.

And when we say something has happened is equal to the event. An event in the past.

Can I say now Event = Fact? I think is true.
But I can’t say that Fact is an Event?
