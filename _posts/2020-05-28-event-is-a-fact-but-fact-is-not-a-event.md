Les's start with facts. How to understood fact. 

*This is some kind of truth. Off course if we don't manipulate facts.*

I we will see a past. The history is filled with many facts. Some are more important other aren't.
But the fact always have some strong and important information. 

If we know the facts? We can tell a story, stories.
That same fact can be core of many stories.
Fact is an information about something was happened.
That is a truth.

And when we say something was happened is equal to event. Event in the past.

Can I say now Event = Fact? I think is a true.

But I can't say that Fact is an Event?
