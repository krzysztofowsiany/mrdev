### Hi! If you are here. You are probably interested about Events like me.

I'am a developer of **.NET** platform from couple years.
Before that I have many other romances with different languages.

So like you good think. I'm an old developer. From 92, when I was writing my first code.

Time to time I'm a public speaker and trainer.

My last love is **Event Storming** and **Event Modeling**. I was make couple free workshops about these techniques.

This drive me to thinks about events and facts. And I think a lot about events :D.

This blog is an effect of my thinking.
